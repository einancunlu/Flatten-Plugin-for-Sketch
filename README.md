# Flatten Plugin for Sketch

Version 2 is here! Check out my new [Medium post](https://medium.com/@einancunlu/flatten-2-0-sketch-plugin-f53984696990) for all the details!

# Changelog

## v2.0.1

### New Features
- Layer mirroring: Now you can mirror a normal layer by creating a shared style. The plugin will update it automatically when you flatten again.
- Auto flattening: If you select "Flattened Image" layers in groups or artboards, they will be updated automatically.
- Auto toggling: Select the hidden actual layer to make it visible automatically. Select the flattened image back to toggle it back and update.
- New tags: #no-auto, #stay-hidden, #sx.xx, #exclude. (Check out the new Medium post for all the details.)
- Settings panel for customizing the values like flattening scale (quality), style name prefix etc. You can also turn on and off the automated features.
- Unflattening: Select a flattened group and unflatten to revert it back. If you unflatten an artboard image layer, it will change the name to match the artboard it's connected to.
- Now, there is no need to add artboard color or to keep the layer inside the borders of the artboard to be able to flatten it correctly. Flatten everything everywhere!
